@article{Mathieu2015,
	Abstract = {Abstract The response of soil carbon dynamics to climate and land-use change will affect both the future climate and the quality of ecosystems. Deep soil carbon (>20 cm) is the primary component of the soil carbon pool, but the dynamics of deep soil carbon remain poorly understood. Therefore, radiocarbon activity (C), which is a function of the age of carbon, may help to understand the rates of soil carbon biodegradation and stabilization. We analyzed the published C contents in 122 profiles of mineral soil that were well distributed in most of the large world biomes, except for the boreal zone. With a multivariate extension of a linear mixed-effects model whose inference was based on the parallel combination of two algorithms, the expectation--maximization (EM) and the Metropolis--Hasting algorithms, we expressed soil C profiles as a four-parameter function of depth. The four-parameter model produced insightful predictions of soil C as dependent on depth, soil type, climate, vegetation, land-use and date of sampling (). Further analysis with the model showed that the age of topsoil carbon was primarily affected by climate and cultivation. By contrast, the age of deep soil carbon was affected more by soil taxa than by climate and thus illustrated the strong dependence of soil carbon dynamics on other pedologic traits such as clay content and mineralogy.},

@book{Fry2006,
	Abstract = {I remember the first time I discovered the power of stable isotopes. It was by accident. It was thirty years ago, when I was a beginning graduate student along the south Texas coast. That summer I helped a visiting professor collect rodents (mice, rats, and ground squirrels) in a coastal sand dune community. Yes, I worked with the rodent traps, but I also got bored and wandered off during the hot afternoon hours, collecting plants and grasshoppers from the dunes. One evening later in that summer of 1976 we were at the mass spectrometer, watching the chart recorder display the isotope results for our collections. It was fascinating. One sample was very enriched in the heavy carbon stable isotope, 13C, and the next sample was depleted in 13C. A great divide was evident in the isotopes of the sand dune community.We watched the chart recorder for hours as sample after sample showed the basic 13C distinction, or variations on this 13C isotope theme.},

@article{Adame2011,
	Abstract = {Mangrove forests exchange materials with the coastal ocean through tidal inundation. In this study, we aim to provide an overview of the published data of carbon (C) and nutrient exchange of mangrove forests with the coastal ocean at different spatial scales to assess whether the exchange is correlated with environmental parameters. We collected data on C (dissolved and particulate organic C; DOC and POC) and nutrient exchange (dissolved and particulate nitrogen, N and phosphorus, P) and examined the role of latitude, temperature, precipitation, geomorphological setting, hydrology, dominant mangrove species and forest area in explaining the variability of the exchange. We identified that there are a range of methodologies used to determine material exchange of mangroves with the coastal zone, each methodology providing data on the exchange at different spatial scales. This variability of approaches has limited our understanding of the role of mangroves in the coastal zone. Regardless, we found that mangrove forests export C and nutrients to the coastal zone in the form of litter and POC. We found that precipitation is a major factor influencing the export of C in the form of litter; sites with low annual precipitation and high mean annual temperatures export more C as litter than sites with high precipitation and low temperature. Furthermore, export of POC is higher in zones with low mean annual minimum temperature. Identification of broad-scale trends in DOC and dissolved nutrients was more difficult, as the analysis was limited by scarcity of suitable studies and high variability in experimental approaches. However, tidal amplitude and the concentration of nutrients in the floodwater appears to be important in determining nutrient exchange. The strongest conclusion from our analysis is that mangrove forests are in general sources of C and nutrients in the form of litter and POC and that they are most likely to be exporting C subsidies in dry regions.},

@article{McCaffrey,
	Abstract = {Brines and salt were sampled at the Morton Bahamas solar salt production facility on Great Inagua Island in the Bahamas. The brines were analyzed by ion chromatography to define more precisely than heretofore the evaporation path of seawater to the end of the halite facies. At Inagua, calcium carbonate begins to precipitate at a brine concentration of about 1.8 times that of seawater. Gypsum begins to precipitate at a brine concentration of 3.8 times seawater, and halite at a concentration factor of 10.6. Three of the most concentrated brines from Inagua (40 times seawater) were evaporated further in the laboratory. Magnesium sulfate first precipitated at brine concentrations about 70 times those of seawater, and potassium-bearing phases began to precipitate from these brines at concentrations greater than 90 times those of seawater. The distribution coefficients of Br (super -) and K (super +) between brines and halite were determined by combining analytical data for the Inagua brines with measurements of the Br (super -) and K (super +) content of halites from Inagua and of halite which had precipitated from Inagua brines during storage. The observed average value of D (sub BR-) is 0.032, in good agreement with some of the previous measurements. The measured values of D (sub K+) are highly variable (0.001 to 0.021); D (sub K+) for halite precipitated early in the halite facies is in the vicinity of 0.015.},
