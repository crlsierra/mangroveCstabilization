@article{Adame2011,
	Abstract = {Mangrove forests exchange materials with the coastal ocean through tidal inundation. In this study, we aim to provide an overview of the published data of carbon (C) and nutrient exchange of mangrove forests with the coastal ocean at different spatial scales to assess whether the exchange is correlated with environmental parameters. We collected data on C (dissolved and particulate organic C; DOC and POC) and nutrient exchange (dissolved and particulate nitrogen, N and phosphorus, P) and examined the role of latitude, temperature, precipitation, geomorphological setting, hydrology, dominant mangrove species and forest area in explaining the variability of the exchange. We identified that there are a range of methodologies used to determine material exchange of mangroves with the coastal zone, each methodology providing data on the exchange at different spatial scales. This variability of approaches has limited our understanding of the role of mangroves in the coastal zone. Regardless, we found that mangrove forests export C and nutrients to the coastal zone in the form of litter and POC. We found that precipitation is a major factor influencing the export of C in the form of litter; sites with low annual precipitation and high mean annual temperatures export more C as litter than sites with high precipitation and low temperature. Furthermore, export of POC is higher in zones with low mean annual minimum temperature. Identification of broad-scale trends in DOC and dissolved nutrients was more difficult, as the analysis was limited by scarcity of suitable studies and high variability in experimental approaches. However, tidal amplitude and the concentration of nutrients in the floodwater appears to be important in determining nutrient exchange. The strongest conclusion from our analysis is that mangrove forests are in general sources of C and nutrients in the form of litter and POC and that they are most likely to be exporting C subsidies in dry regions.},

@article{McCaffrey,
	Abstract = {Brines and salt were sampled at the Morton Bahamas solar salt production facility on Great Inagua Island in the Bahamas. The brines were analyzed by ion chromatography to define more precisely than heretofore the evaporation path of seawater to the end of the halite facies. At Inagua, calcium carbonate begins to precipitate at a brine concentration of about 1.8 times that of seawater. Gypsum begins to precipitate at a brine concentration of 3.8 times seawater, and halite at a concentration factor of 10.6. Three of the most concentrated brines from Inagua (40 times seawater) were evaporated further in the laboratory. Magnesium sulfate first precipitated at brine concentrations about 70 times those of seawater, and potassium-bearing phases began to precipitate from these brines at concentrations greater than 90 times those of seawater. The distribution coefficients of Br (super -) and K (super +) between brines and halite were determined by combining analytical data for the Inagua brines with measurements of the Br (super -) and K (super +) content of halites from Inagua and of halite which had precipitated from Inagua brines during storage. The observed average value of D (sub BR-) is 0.032, in good agreement with some of the previous measurements. The measured values of D (sub K+) are highly variable (0.001 to 0.021); D (sub K+) for halite precipitated early in the halite facies is in the vicinity of 0.015.},

This is followed by a colorimetric iron determination using orthophenanthroline. The use of an automatic pipette, a flocculating agent, and noncritical quantities of dry reagents facilitates the determination. The results show increased effectiveness and reliability over Kilmer's porcedure for high-iron Oxisols and Ultisols from Puerto Rico.},
